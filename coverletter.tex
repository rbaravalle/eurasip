\opening{Dear Madame/Sir,}

I would be very grateful if you could consider the following manuscript

Title: Multifractal characterisation and classification of bread crumb digital images,
Authors: Rodrigo Baravalle, Claudio Delrieux, Juan Carlos G\'omez,

for possible publication in the EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing.

We consider that this manuscript is a contribution to the state of the art of image processing, applying and combining complex techniques to a specific application problem. The results that we present are significantly better to what is available in the literature, and the processing techniques we studied are also worth studying in other application contexts. For this reason, we consider that this contribution will be of interest to several potential readers. To the best of our knowledge, there are no potential competing interests or conflict at all.

I will be glad to send you any further information you might need.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
\fromsig{Rodrigo Baravalle}
